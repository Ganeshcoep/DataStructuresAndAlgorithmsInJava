DataStructures,Algorithms and problem solving in Java
==================================================================

Implementation of data structures and algorithms with coding challenges

Folder Structure:

Refer 'src' folder for all the source file/s.

Folder 'Çodility.<Lesson_Name>' contains the solution of the problems hosted at: https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/
It follows the same structure as that in site.
All the solutions are tested and have been passed with 100% score.

JavaConcepts- contains the programs created to test the concepts of the java

gss.algorithms- contains the implementation of the standard algorithms.

gss.algorithms.data_structures- contains the implementation of standard data structures.

gss.coding.problems- contains the coding problems , I have encountered with and thus solved.
